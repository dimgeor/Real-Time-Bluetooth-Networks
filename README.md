> A basic fitness device for the tiva-c launchpad and the mk-II boosterpack based on my custom RTOS.
> It uses the boosterpacks sensors to measure the steps, the light intesity as well as the sounds of the environment. All these information are presented
> with graphs on the LCD.

> The project was made on Keil uVision5.

> The BSP (Board Support Package) files were provided by the instructors.

> Because my MK-II boosterpack came faulty without the temperature sensor I had to modify the BSP files and insert random values. The originals are included.
